This project includes developing and implementing a comprehensive pet health management system for pet owners and administrators. It features modules for health monitoring, symptom analysis, and predictive diagnostics, allowing pet owners to input symptoms and receive immediate feedback on potential health risks using machine learning algorithms. Additionally, the project includes a robust administrative module for efficient pet adoption processes, listing pets with detailed profiles and managing adoption records. Informational modules will provide resources on common diseases, preventive measures, vaccination schedules, and directories of veterinarians and hospitals. The system will also offer tips for routine care, checklists for pet owners, and educational content on various breeds, fostering a proactive approach to pet health management and ensuring comprehensive care throughout pets' lives.
